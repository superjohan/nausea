# "Nausea" by Dekadence

A demo for macOS. (and iOS too)

Made in a few evenings for Jumalauta Winter FÃ¤rjan 2022, mostly because I wanted to try out Mac Catalyst. The demo got 3rd place in the demo competition.

The code is an unstructured mess due to being in a hurry and me changing my mind about the direction of things constantly. (like, there's an ~entirely unused gradient feature for the "byoop" views)

Optimized for 1080p, but should work more or less correctly on any resolution.
